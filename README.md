# dotfiles

This repository contains a small set of configuration files which I use under
Windows and macOS. My goal, wherever practical, is that I shouldn't notice a
great deal of difference when working within each environment.

* Bash configuration files are intended for use under Git Bash on Windows
* Zsh configuration files were written on macOS

The Emacs configuration files are now contained for posterity. After over 30
years of using Emacs, I completely cut over to using VS&nbsp;Code in 2022. I've
included my VS&nbsp;Code configurations from both Windows and macOS, since there
are subtle differences.
