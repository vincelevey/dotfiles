# dotfiles

These files reflect the schism between my work &amp; home life&mdash;that is,
coding under Windows versus coding under macOS. My goal, wherever practical, is
that I shouldn't notice a great deal of difference between the two environments.

* Bash configuration files are intended for use under Git Bash on Windows
* Zsh configuration files were written on macOS

The Emacs configuration files are now contained for posterity. After over 30
years of using Emacs, I completely cut over to using VS&nbsp;Code in 2022. I've
included my VS&nbsp;Code configurations from both Windows and macOS, since there
are subtle differences.
